# Contributing to GitCo

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GitCo! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors to our intelligent OSS fork management tool.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- pip
- GitHub account (for API access)
- LLM API key (OpenAI)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/41technologies/gitco.git
   cd gitco
   ```

2. **Install in development mode:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **Pre-commit** for automated checks

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
black src/

# Lint code
ruff check src/

# Run all checks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Update documentation as needed
- Use type hints for all functions

### 3. Commit Your Changes

We use conventional commits:

```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
git commit -m "feat(cli): add new sync command"

# Examples:
git commit -m "fix(config): resolve YAML parsing error"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: Continuous integration changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `deps`: Dependency updates

### Scopes

- `cli`: Command-line interface
- `config`: Configuration management
- `sync`: Git synchronization
- `analyzer`: AI analysis features
- `discovery`: Issue discovery
- `reporter`: Status and reporting
- `utils`: Utility functions
- `github`: GitHub API integration
- `llm`: LLM provider integrations

### Examples

```bash
feat(cli): add init command for configuration setup
fix(sync): resolve merge conflict handling
docs(readme): update installation instructions

chore(ci): update GitHub Actions workflow
feat(github): add issue discovery functionality
feat(llm): integrate OpenAI API for change analysis
perf(sync): optimize batch processing performance
ci(deps): bump actions/setup-python from 4 to 5
```

## Changelog Generation

We use automated changelog generation based on conventional commits. The changelog is automatically updated during releases.

### Local Changelog Generation

For development, you can generate changelogs locally:

```bash
# Generate a preview changelog
./scripts/generate-changelog.sh preview

# Update the main CHANGELOG.md file
./scripts/generate-changelog.sh update

# Prepare release changelog for a specific version
./scripts/generate-changelog.sh release 1.0.0
```

### Prerequisites for Local Generation

- Node.js (for conventional-changelog-cli)
- Git repository with conventional commits

The script will automatically install `conventional-changelog-cli` if not present.

### Automated Release Process

During releases, the GitHub Actions workflow automatically:

1. Parses conventional commits since the last release
2. Generates changelog entries grouped by type
3. Updates `CHANGELOG.md` with new version
4. Creates release notes for GitHub releases
5. Publishes to PyPI with updated changelog

### Commit Message Requirements

For proper changelog generation, ensure your commits follow the conventional format:

```bash
# ‚úÖ Good - will appear in changelog
git commit -m "feat(cli): add new sync command"
git commit -m "fix(config): resolve YAML parsing error"

# ‚ùå Bad - won't appear in changelog
git commit -m "add new feature"
git commit -m "fix bug"
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. **Run code quality checks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if needed
